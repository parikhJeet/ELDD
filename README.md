Explore Linux Device Driver

Day 0: Setting up the mindset to Learn Embedded Device Driver for Linux

Section A : Common infrastructure

            + Device Driver hello Module Development
            + Memory
            + Timer
            + SysFS
            + ProcFS
            
Section B : User application interface
            
            + Types of Librarys in Linux
            + ELF File format
            + ext2 File System
            + open()-read()-write()-close() File operations
            + Character device driver

Section C : Hardware Register Map

            + Read TRM - Technical Reference Manual
            + GPIO device driver :
                        > Theory - GPIO Framework
                        > Add GPIO entry in Device Tree
                        > Develop : GPIO device driver
                        > Control an LED
            + I2C device driver :
                        > Theory - I2C Framework
                        > Add I2C entry in Device Tree
                        > Develop : I2C device driver
                        > Play with an I2C device
            + SPI Device Driver :
                        > Theory - SPI Framework
                        > Add SPI entry in Device Tree
                        > Develop : SPI device driver
                        > Play with an SPI device
